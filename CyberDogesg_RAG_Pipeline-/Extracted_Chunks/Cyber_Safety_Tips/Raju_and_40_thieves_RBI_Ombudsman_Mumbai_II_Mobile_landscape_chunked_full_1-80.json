As the name suggests, ‘Raju and the Forty Thieves’ contains forty such stories\nproviding glimpses of fraudulent events being reported to us and provides simple\ntips about DOs and DON'Ts. Raju is a typical gullible citizen, and, in these\nstories, he appears in different characters, some time as a senior citizen, some time\nas a farmer, sometimes as a happy-go-lucky guy, etc., although with same curly hair always to identify with different walks of life. Let us make ourselves aware of such modus operandi used by fraudsters and educate\nthose around us to be aware of such financial frauds. ‘The tireless efforts put by the\nteam of RBI Ombudsman, Mumbai-II, Maharashtra and Goa, to spread financial\nliteracy by preparing such booklets during covid period, is gratefully acknowledged. The readers are requested to share their feedback and suggestions, if any, to bomumbai2@rbi.org.in. Be Aware and Beware!"
