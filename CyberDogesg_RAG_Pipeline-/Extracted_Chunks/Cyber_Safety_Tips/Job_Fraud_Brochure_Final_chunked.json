Nowadays all our employment search begins online and this gives an opportunity to cybercriminals to trick us into scams.\n\nJob frauds are sophisticated scams offering fictitious job opportunities to job seekers. These frauds are normally done through online services such as bogus websites or unsolicited e-mails claiming to be from known companies or brands. It has become difficult to determine whether a job offer is legitimate or fake."

    "text": "You can always stay one step ahead of fraudsters and find a legitimate job by following these tips:\n\n1. Avoid opportunities on search engine advertisements:\n   Always search and apply for jobs posted on authentic job portals or newspapers. Do not apply for jobs posted on search engine ads, social media advertisements, or labelled sponsored links or results.\n\n2. Check privacy policy of job sites:\n   Before registering on any job search portal, check the privacy policy of the website to know the type of information collected from the user and how it will be processed.\n\n3. Do research:\n   Always try to check the company's website if you have found a job opportunity on any other website to verify authenticity and learn more about the profile. Legitimate companies usually list vacancies under the 'Careers' section of their official websites."

    "text": "4. Always keep a note of where you've applied for jobs. Do not respond to any generic emails from unknown companies, as they could be scams.\n\n5. Fake Government Jobs:\n   Always check the website of Government organisations for details about job openings. All government websites have 'gov.in' or 'nic.in' as part of their domain (e.g., www.mha.gov.in). Government departments advertise vacancies in leading newspapers and Employment News.\n\n6. Check for spelling mistakes:\n   Look for spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors in job emails. Fake emails may have similar-looking domains such as 'Info@company.net' instead of 'Info@company.com' or misspellings like 'Info@companie.com'.\n\nFollow @CyberDost on Twitter for cyber safety tips.\nwww.cybercrime.gov.in"

    "text": "7. Use verified job portals:\n   Many job portals offer paid services for resume writing, resume promotion, and job alerts. Before paying, check reviews and authenticity of the website. Consult family or friends for reliable portals.\n\n8. Never pay for a job:\n   Beware of emails offering jobs in exchange for money. No legitimate organisation asks for payment to offer employment.\n\n9. Online interview:\n   Many organisations now conduct interviews through phone, chat, or video calls. Always verify the organisation and interviewer before proceeding. Ask detailed questions about the job and company."
