Be it communicating with friends, searching for information, doing banking transactions, \navailing online services, finding job, finding life partner or even running entire businesses. The \ninternet touches almost all aspects of our lives. However, it also makes us vulnerable to a wide \nrange of threats.\nNew and powerful cyber-attacks are striking the internet regularly. A minor lapse in managing our \ndigital lives can open the door to cyber criminals. Cyber criminals can steal our money or damage \nour reputation. According to a study by a leading industry research organization, 90% of all cyber-\nattacks are caused by human negligence. Therefore, cyber security awareness is important for \neveryone today.\nWe must be vigilant while making use of technology to reduce the risk of cyber threats.\nTypes of Cybercrime\nA cybercrime is a crime involving computers and networks. This includes a wide range of activities, \nfrom illegally downloading music files to stealing money from online bank accounts. Cyber criminals \nare not always financially motivated.

    "text": "9\nIDENTITY\nTHEFT\nWhat is Identity Theft?\nIdentity theft is the act of wrongfully obtaining someone’s personal information (that defines one’s \nidentity) without their permission. The personal information may include their name, phone number, \naddress, bank account number, Aadhaar number or credit/debit card number etc.\nIdentity theft can have many adverse effects. The fraudster can use stolen personal information and \nidentity proofs to:\n• \ngain access to your bank accounts\n• \napply for loans and credit cards or open insurance accounts\n• \nfile a tax refund in your name and get your refund\n• \nobtain a driver’s license, passport or immigration papers\n• \ncreate new utility accounts\n• \nget medical treatment on your health insurance\n• \nassume your identity on social media\n• \ngive your name to the police during an arrest etc.\nHence, everyone should be aware about identity theft and should know how to prevent it. Let us \nlook at some examples of identity theft.\nHacking or gaining access to Social Media Accounts\nThe attacker hacks or gains access to the social media account of the victim. The attacker can then \nharm the victim by misusing their personal information and photographs. The attacker can also post \noffensive content on victim’s profile or defame the victim.\nMisuse of photo copies of identity proofs\nThe attacker misuses the photo copies of identity proofs of the victim. These can be PAN Card, \nAadhaar Card or any other identity proof of the victim. The attacker can use these photo copies to \nsteal money or cause harm to the victim.\nCredit/Debit Card Skimming\nCredit/Debit card skimming is done using a small device called skimmer. The magnetic stripe of the \ncard stores details such as name, credit/debit card number and expiration date. First, the credit/\ndebit card is swiped through a skimmer. Then, the skimmer captures all these details. Thieves use \nthis stolen data to make online transactions. They also use this data to create duplicate credit/debit \ncards and withdraw money from ATM."

    "text": "17\nPSYCHOLOGICAL\nTRICKS\nWhat are Psychological Tricks?\nPsychological tricks are where attackers play with the minds of the user to trap them with lucrative \noffers. Once trapped, the attackers can exploit the victim by either stealing money or stealing \nsensitive personal information (name, Aadhaar details, bank account details etc.) or harm the victim \nin any other way. The entire basis of this kind of attack is to make the victim fall into their trap by \nsending fake e-mails, calls or SMSs.\nPhishing is the act of sending fraudulent e-mail that appears to be from a legitimate source, for \nexample, a bank, a recruiter or a credit card company etc. This is done in an attempt to gain \nsensitive personal information, bank account details etc. from the victim.\nVishing is similar to phishing. But, instead of e-mail, in this type of crime, the fraudster uses \ntelephone to obtain sensitive personal and financial information. \nSmishing is the SMS equivalent of phishing. It uses SMS to send fraudulent text messages. The \nSMS asks the recipient to visit a website/weblink or call a phone number. The victim is then tricked \ninto providing sensitive personal information, debit/credit card details or passwords etc.\nPhishing, Vishing and Smishing are done in an attempt to steal money from the victim or cause any \nother harm to the victim.\nLet us look at some examples of psychological tricks.\nLottery Fraud\nThe fraudster congratulates the victim for winning a handsome lottery via e-mail/call/SMS. The \nvictim is delighted and is eager to get the lottery money. The fraudster asks the victim to transfer a \ntoken amount and share vital personal information to get the lottery money. The victim loses his/her \nmoney and does not get anything in return.\nCredit/Debit Card Fraud\nThe attacker tries to scare the victim by informing them that their credit/debit card has been blocked. \nThe victim becomes worried and starts panicking. The attacker takes advantage of this situation \nand asks victim to provide sensitive personal information to re-activate the card. This information is \nthen misused to steal money or cause harm to the victim.\nJob Related Fraud\nThe attacker sends a fake e-mail to the victim offering a job with an attractive salary. The victim, \nunfortunately, believes it and follows the instructions. The attacker then steals the money or harms \nthe victim physically."

It is the new way of communicating, sharing \nand informing people about the events in our lives. We share our day to day lives on social media in \nthe form of self and family photographs, updates on our locations/whereabouts, our views/thoughts \non prevalent topics etc. One can understand the entire history of an individual through their social \nmedia profile and can even predict future events based on patterns in the past.\nThis poses a threat to an individual as unwanted access to social media profile can cause loss of \ninformation, defamation or even worse consequences such as physical/sexual assault, robbery etc. \nHence, protection and appropriate use of social media profile is very important.\nLet us look at some examples of social media frauds.\nSympathy Fraud\nThe attacker becomes friends with the victim on social media. The attacker gains trust by frequent \ninteractions. The attacker later extracts money/harms the victim.\nRomance Fraud\nThe attacker becomes friends with the victim on social media. Over a period, the attacker gains \nvictim’s affection.

As a result, they ignore security \nwarnings. Fraudsters use this to attack the victim by infiltrating through such popular mobile \napplications.

Services like retrieving account statement, funds \ntransfer to other accounts, requesting a cheque book, preparing demand draft etc. can all be done \nonline. Most of these services can be done sitting at home without physically visiting the bank. \nAs the services are shifting towards online platforms, cyber frauds related to banking are also \nincreasing. Just like we protect our locker full of jewelry with a lock and key, we must protect our \nonline bank accounts with strong passwords. If the key is stolen, then the jewelry will be stolen. \nSimilarly, if the password is stolen, then the money in the bank accounts will be stolen. Hence, \nprotection of bank accounts with strong passwords becomes highly essential.\nLet us look at some examples of online banking fraud.\nDigital Payments Applications related attacks\nDigital payments have become very common in today’s life. However, they do pose a threat if the \naccount is hacked.\nHacking of Bank Account due to Weak Password\nIn this type of attack, the attacker hacks into the victim’s account by using a program to guess \ncommonly used passwords. Once the account is hacked, the attacker can steal money or perform \nan illegal transaction in order to defame or frame the victim.\nHacking of Multiple Accounts due to same password\nIf same password is used for multiple accounts, then hacking of one account may also lead to \nhacking of other accounts."
