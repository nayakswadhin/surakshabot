But overall, the scale of financial \nloss underscores how pervasive cybercrime \nhas become across Gujarat. \nThe data shows that Ahmedabad City reported \nthe highest number of cybercrime calls \n(28,382), followed by Surat City (20,102) and \nVadodara City (10,433). Smaller districts were \nnot spared either: rural regions like Surat Rural \n(3,320) and Rajkot Rural (2,407) also recorded \nthousands of complaints.  \nDespite \nongoing \ncoordination \nbetween \nGujarat’s CID Cyber Cell, district-level cyber \nunits, and agencies in other states, fraudsters \ncontinue to adapt rapidly. Officials said that \nscammers increasingly use social engineering, \nmanipulating fear and trust to trap people. \nSupreme Court Calls ₹3,000-Crore Digital Arrest “Shocking,” Seeks \nAction \nIndia’s Supreme Court on Monday expressed \noutrage over the country’s escalating cyber \nfraud epidemic, after being informed that \nnearly ₹3,000 crore had been extorted from \ncitizens through “digital arrest” scams and \nsimilar schemes. \nThe remarks came during a suo motu \nhearing—one initiated by the court itself—to \naddress the growing menace of cyber scams in \nwhich criminals impersonate government \nofficials, law enforcement officers, or judges \nto extort money from victims under the guise \nof investigations or arrests. \nMonday’s hearing underscored both the scale \nand sophistication of the threat. As the Court \nnoted, the reported ₹3,000-crore figure likely \nrepresents only a fraction of the total losses, \nwith thousands of unreported cases scattered \nacross the country. \nThe hearing was triggered by a letter from a \nsenior citizen couple who said they were duped \nof ₹1.5 crore in September by fraudsters \nposing as officials from the CBI, Intelligence \nBureau, and the judiciary. The scammers \ncontacted \nthem \nvia \nphone \nand \nvideo \nconferencing, even displaying forged Supreme \nCourt \norders \nto \nintimidate \nthem \ninto \ntransferring money. \nDelhi top cop issues norms on handling e-FIRs in cybercrime incidents \nA day after the Delhi Police announced the \nlaunching of a new system that will \nautomatically convert cybercrime complaints \nwith fraud value above ₹1 lakh into e-FIRs, the \nchief of the police force, Satish Golchha on \nFriday issued a circular detailing the procedure \nto be followed by investigating officers (IOs) \nin such cases and the creation of cyber help \ndesks at all the 200 plus police stations across \nthe city. \nAccording to the circular, while e-FIRs against \ncyber fraud complaints with value above ₹1 \nlakh will be registered at the police stations, \nthe cases shall be transferred to the concerned \ndepartment, depending on the fraud amount. \n“If the fraud value is up to ₹25 lakh, the e-FIRs \nwill be sent to the cyber police station of the \nconcerned district. When the cheating amount \nis above ₹25 lakh and up to ₹50 lakh, the crime \nbranch’s cyber cell will investigate such cases. \nThe \nintelligence \nfusion \nand \nstrategic"

These messages \noften appear authentic but are part of a scam \ndesigned to steal personal or financial \ninformation. \nOfficials have highlighted several red flags \nthat citizens should watch out for. Suspicious \napps such as “Traffic Fine” or “RTO Challan” \nare being shared through unknown numbers. \nSimilarly, links that do not end with “.gov.in” \nor those not connected to the official \nwebsite parivahan.gov.in should be avoided. \nResidents are urged not to click on unfamiliar \nlinks, download unknown applications, or \nshare personal information with unverified \nsources. If anyone receives such messages, \nthey should alert friends and family to prevent \nfurther spread of the scam. Victims or those \nwho receive fake messages are advised to \nreport them immediately by calling 1930, \nvisiting cybercrime.gov.in, or filing a report \nthrough CHAKSHU on sancharsaathi.gov.i\nn. FIRs can also be lodged at the nearest police \nstation or cyber cell. \nNoida Furniture Dealer Loses Lakhs in Cyber Fraud \nIn Sector 10, Noida, a furniture dealer was \ndefrauded of ₹22 lakh by cybercriminals who \nlured him with promises of high returns from \nstock market investments. The accused, a \nwoman claiming to be a stock market expert, \npersuaded the victim to make multiple small \ninvestments, ultimately siphoning off ₹22 \nlakh. The victim filed a complaint with the \nCyber Crime Police Station, and authorities are \ncurrently conducting a detailed investigation. \nDheerpal Singh, a resident of Badayun Rota \nvillage in Sector 10, Noida, operates a \nfurniture showroom and office under the name \n“Shri Balaji,” manufacturing furniture for \nlarge offices and commercial buildings. Singh \nalso had an interest in stock market \ninvestments. \nOn August 10, Singh received a WhatsApp \nmessage from a woman identifying herself as \nSaloni Chaudhary. She cited a slowdown in his \nbusiness and advised him to start a side \nbusiness. Claiming to be a stock market expert, \nthe fraudster promised that any investment \nmade would yield double returns. Singh was \nregistered on an app by the accused and \npersuaded to invest. Over 12–15 days, he \ntransferred a total of ₹22 lakh to the fraudsters. \nWhen he attempted to withdraw his money, the \nscammers demanded additional “taxes” and \nservice charges and threatened to freeze his \naccount. Upon Singh’s refusal to pay further, \nthe perpetrators cut off communication."

The theft of goods in transit in \nthe U.S. rose 27% in 2024 and is expected to \nspike another 22% this year, according to the \nNational Insurance Crime Bureau.  \nIt’s estimated that the industry loses $35 \nbillion annually to cargo theft. Increasingly, \nthis theft involves a cyber component, with \ncriminals taking advantage of an increasingly \ndigitized system to intercept goods.  \nProofpoint researchers have been observing a \nthreat cluster active since at least June that has \ndemonstrated a deep “knowledge of how the \ntrucking and transportation industries work.”  \nThe hackers use a handful of tactics, including \ninfiltrating load boards — marketplaces where \nshippers and freight brokers connect with \ncarriers — where they advertise fraudulent \nloads. When a carrier responds, they send \nemails with malicious URLs. In some cases, \nthey compromise email accounts and send \nmessages laden with malicious links that, \nwhen clicked, install legitimate remote \nmonitoring and management tools like \nScreenConnect, PDQ Connect and Fleetdeck. \nKELA launches National Cyber Resilience Suite to strengthen defense \nagainst nation-state actors and cybercrime \nKELA, vendor of cyber threat intelligence and \nexternal \nthreat \nexposure \nmanagement, \nannounced the launch of its National Cyber \nResilience Suite, a solution designed for \ngovernments, national CERTs, and law \nenforcement agencies to strengthen their \ndefenses against nation-state actors and \norganized cybercrime.  \nThe National Cyber Resilience Suite is \nintended to help combat these growing \nchallenges and brings together KELA’s \nproprietary data lake and intelligence data \nfusion capabilities, powered by AI-driven \ncyber \nanalysts, \ndesigned \nto \nmeet \nthe \noperational needs of national defense and \nsecurity organizations.
