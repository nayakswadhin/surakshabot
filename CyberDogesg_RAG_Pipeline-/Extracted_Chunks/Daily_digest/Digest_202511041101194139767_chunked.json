The \naction has been taken as part of the ongoing \n‘Operation Chakra-V’ against cybercriminals. \nThe agency has identified the accused as \nDwibendu Moharana, who was intercepted at \nBhubaneswar airport on his return to India on \nThursday (October 30, 2025). \n“Following coordinated searches conducted on \nMay 28, 2025, at 19 locations across Delhi, \nHaryana, and Uttar Pradesh, which led to the \narrest of six operatives, Moharana had \nabsconded from Bhubaneswar to the United \nArab Emirates on May 29, 2025, immediately \nafter his call centre at Voip Connect Private \nLimited, Noida, was uncovered,” the agency \nsaid on Saturday. \nIts investigations revealed that Mr. Moharana \noperated the illegal call centre that was \ninvolved in sophisticated social engineering \nand deception, according to the agency.  \nDelhi Police Bust Cybercrime Syndicate Run By Indian Man Based In \nDubai \nThe Delhi Police has busted a pan-India cyber \nfraud syndicate allegedly run by a Dubai-based \nIndian kingpin, arresting five people including \na relationship manager of a bank for \nfacilitating fraudulent financial transactions, \nofficials said on Friday. \nAccording to police, the syndicate operated \nfake firms and opened multiple current \naccounts to launder the funds cheated from \nvictims across at least 12 states. \n\"The accused allegedly earned Rs 1.5 lakh \ncommission for every bank account opened for \nthe racket's operations,\" read a statement \nissued by crime branch. \nThe accused -- Manjeet Singh (28), Manshvi \n(23), Manish Mehra (33), Sombir (43), and \nAnup (35), a bank official -- were apprehended \nfrom Delhi, Gurugram, and Hisar during the \ncoordinated raids conducted after tracing their \nlocations through digital surveillance.

The caller, claiming to be a courier \nagent, accused Santhosh of using his Aadhaar \ncard to book a suspicious parcel containing \nexpired passports, credit cards, clothes, and \nbanned LSD drugs. \nPosing \nas \nofficers \nfrom \nthe \nMumbai \nCybercrime unit and later the Narcotics \nControl Bureau, the fraudsters told him that his \nAadhaar had been misused for illegal money \ntransfers linked to terrorism. They demanded \npayment to clear him from the case. Believing \nthe claims, Santhosh took a personal loan of Rs \n19.92 lakh from ICICI bank and transferred it \nto their accounts. \nFollowing an investigation, a special team \narrested the suspects — Naresh Kalyan Rao \nShinde (20) and Srikanth Suresh Rao Khatkar \n(34) — from Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Both \nwere produced in court and remanded in \ncustody. \nAsst engineer’s e-mail hacked, abusive complaint filed against senior in \nMohali \nPolice have lodged an FIR after the e-mail ID \nof an assistant engineer at Nayagaon municipal \ncouncil was hacked, and used to file a false and \nabusive complaint against a junior engineer on \nthe central government’s centralised public \ngrievance gramin portal. \nThe matter came to light when assistant \nengineer Harbhajan Singh received an official \nphone call, informing him that action had been \ntaken on a complaint allegedly filed by him. \nShocked by the revelation, Singh clarified that \nhe had made no such complaint and \nimmediately reported the matter to the Cyber \nCrime police station. \nIn his statement, Harbhajan said his official \nemail was hacked, and a fake complaint \ncontaining obscene and derogatory language \nagainst the junior engineer was submitted on \nthe central portal to tarnish their image. He \nadded that another similar complaint, against \nan outsourced clerk Satveer Singh, had been \nfiled using the hacked e-mail ID. \nActing on his complaint, the cyber police \nlaunched a probe and obtained details of the \nuser ID, mobile number and IP address of the \ncomplainant from the central department of \nadministrative reforms and public grievances.  \nBased on these findings, police booked Rakesh \nunder Sections 204 (impersonating a public \nservant), 356 (defamation), and 296 (use of \nobscene language) of the Bharatiya Nyaya \nSanhita (BNS), along with Section 66C of the \nIT Act. \nOver 3,000 cases of WhatsApp hacking scam reported in Tamil Nadu \nWhatsApp, once merely a social media \nplatform for communication, has evolved into \nan essential part of daily life — extending its \nreach from personal messaging to business \ncoordination and even official communication \nsuch as service of summons. However, the \nincreasing reliance on the app has also exposed \nusers to new forms of cyber threats, police \nsaid. Despite its end-to-end encryption, \nWhatsApp is witnessing a surge in hacking-\nrelated scams that exploit user negligence. In \nTamil Nadu alone, the Cyber Crime Wing has \nrecorded over 3,000 such complaints in 2025. \nAdditional Director General of Police, Cyber \nCrime Wing, Sandeep Mittal said, “Being an \nend-to-end encrypted message medium, any \ncareless or negligible usage costs huge sums of"

Recently, we have \nseen an increase in WhatsApp hacking scams.” \nThere is no uniform modus operandi in \nWhatsApp hacking scams. But all the common \ntactics involve a mix of technical tricks and \nconvincing users their actions are harmless or \neven necessary. \nA new wave of targeted WhatsApp fraud uses \nfake RTO (Regional Transport Office) challan \nmessages to trick vehicle owners into \ninstalling malicious software. The message \nlooks alarmingly real which includes the \nvictim’s vehicle number, a brief description of \nthe alleged offence, and a clickable “pay \nchallan” link. \nFake Website Review Jobs Lead to ₹16.6 Lakh Cyber Loss \nA 26-year-old sales executive from Vadodara \nhas fallen victim to a sophisticated cyber fraud, \nlosing ₹16.60 lakh to a gang that posed as \nonline employers offering commissions for \n“website review tasks.” The Vadodara Cyber \nCrime Police have registered a case and begun \ntracing digital footprints after the victim \nalleged he was tricked by fraudsters using \nmultiple \nTelegram \naccounts \nand \nfake \ninvestment websites that mimicked legitimate \nplatforms. \nThe youth was drawn in by offers of quick \nearnings — a familiar lure in India’s growing \nwave of “task-based” cyber scams, which have \nevolved from fake trading and crypto \nplatforms into crowdsourced review schemes. \nAccording to the complaint, the fraud began on \nJuly 13, 2025, when the victim received a \nTelegram message inviting him to earn \ncommissions by “reviewing” and “liking” \nproducts on websites. The Vadodara Cyber \nCrime Police have launched a probe to identify \nthe perpetrators and are tracking digital \nwallets, bank transfers, and Telegram handles \nlinked to the case. \nPune man accepts 'make me pregnant' online ad offer, ends up losing Rs \n11 lakh \nA contractor in Pune lost Rs 11 lakh to cyber \nfraud after he accepted an offer by a 'woman' \nwho sought to be made pregnant by someone \nin exchange for money. The man was conned \nafter he responded positively, and went ahead \nwith exploring an online advertisement that \nread, \"Looking for a man who can make me \npregnant\". \nThe incident has exposed links to a nationwide \ncyber racket known as the \"Pregnant Job\" or \n\"Playboy Service\" scam, which has been \nactive across several states since 2022, \nofficials said. According to the complaint filed \nby the contractor, he came across the \nadvertisement online and responded to it. Soon \nafter, a woman sent him a video requesting him \nto impregnate her, and a link to the video was \nshared with him. Senior police inspector \nChandrashekhar Sawant said the conmen \ntricked the contractor into paying various types \ncharges. Over a period, the fraudsters extracted \nan aggregate amount of around Rs 11 lakh \nfrom the contractor through multiple online \ntransfers. \"Citizens should avoid responding to \nsuspicious online advertisements or offers. If \nanyone demands large sums of money online \nfor personal work, they must report it \nimmediately to the police,\" Sawant said."

The new initiative aims to \nalign \nthe \ngrowing \ndemand \nfor \ncyber \nreinsurance in APAC with global capacity, \noffering a flexible and comprehensive solution \nto meet the region's unique needs. \nAccording to Gallagher Re the untapped \npotential of the cyber market lies in fostering \ngrowth through international markets and \ninnovative cyber products rather than relying \non saturated markets. The newly developed \nfacility framework serves as the infrastructure \nto support this vision, enabling the industry to \n\"mine for growth\" rather than \"pan for \ngrowth\". \nA press release issued by the brokerage said, \n“The framework is designed to match cyber \ncapacity with cyber need, across all market \nsegments, from personal lines to SMEs, \nmidmarket, and large enterprises. \nThe framework has already garnered active \ninterest from Tier 1 reinsurers and domestic \nmarkets, and will prioritise APAC-based \ncapacity and capability, ensuring better \nservicing through local time zones and \naddressing \nclients’ \ndesire \nfor \nregional \nleadership in this area. \nChina’s ‘Typhoon’ cyber operations target US critical infrastructure \nsectors in move toward large-scale disruption \nA new report from Auburn University’s \nMcCrary Institute for Cyber and Critical \nInfrastructure \nSecurity \nidentifies \nsector-\nspecific risks, noting that cyber intrusions \nacross \nU.S. energy, \nwater, \ntelecommunications, transportation, \nand \nhealthcare \ninfrastructures \nsuggest \nthat \nPeople’s Republic of China (PRC)-linked \n‘Typhoon’ hackers are probing critical systems \nto enable large-scale disruption in future \nconflicts. These installations have faced state-\nsponsored cyber operations, referred to by \nMicrosoft as ‘Typhoons,’ indicating Beijing’s \npreparations for potential conflict. These \nactivities aim to disrupt logistics, delay \nmilitary deployments, and target essential \ncivilian systems.  \nThe report highlights a significant shift in \nChina’s offensive cyber strategy, evolving \nfrom espionage to the potential for widespread \ndisruption. Countering this growing threat \nrequires a comprehensive, coordinated effort \nthat involves cybersecurity, intelligence, \ndiplomacy, and resilience across governments \nand allied nations.
