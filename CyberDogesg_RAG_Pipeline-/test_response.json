  "answer": "📋 **National Cybercrime Reporting Portal**\n\n1. **Brief Overview:**\n   The National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) allows you to report various cybercrimes online. Preparing relevant information and evidence beforehand will streamline the reporting process.\n\n2. **Detailed Steps/Tips:**\n   • **Gather Evidence:** Collect all relevant evidence related to the cybercrime. This may include:\n        • Screenshots of SMS messages, social media posts, or website content containing offensive or illegal material. For example, if you received cyberbullying SMS messages, take screenshots showing the content and sender details.\n        • Copies of emails, either saved as PDF or .EML files, or scanned printouts. If emails have attachments, keep those ready for upload as well.\n        • Transaction details, bank account information, and any other details related to financial loss if money was stolen.\n        • URLs, company names, email IDs, and mobile numbers associated with the incident.\n   • **Document Dates and Times:** Note the exact dates and times when you received suspicious messages, calls, or when the incident occurred. This information is crucial for the \"Incident Description\" field when filing your complaint.\n   • **WhatsApp Chat Export:** If the cybercrime involves WhatsApp, export the relevant chat history. You can export with or without media, but note the limitations: up to 10,000 recent messages with media, or 40,000 messages without media, due to email size restrictions. To export, go to the chat, tap the three dots, select \"More,\" then \"Export chat.\" Choose whether to include media or not, and then send the chat via email.\n   • **Reporting Process:**\n        • Visit the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal: cybercrime.gov.in.\n        • Click on \"File a Complaint.\"\n        • Read and accept the acknowledgement.\n        • Select the appropriate category of cybercrime. If it's \"Hacking\", select that option. For other cybercrimes, choose \"Report Other Cyber Crime.\"\n        • Log in to the portal.\n        • Provide all required details in the complaint form, including incident details.\n        • Upload the evidence you have collected.\n   • **Preview and Submit:** Before submitting, carefully review all the information you've provided. If you need to make changes, click \"Back\" to edit. Once you're satisfied, click \"Confirm & Submit\" to finalize your complaint.\n\n3. **Important Warnings:**\n   • Be careful while providing information and ensure the details are accurate.\n   • Do not fabricate or exaggerate any details related to the incident.\n   • Preserve all evidence in its original form whenever possible.\n\n4. **Contact Information:**\n   • National Cybercrime Reporting Portal: cybercrime.gov.in\n   • Cybercrime Helpline Number: 1930\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n**📞 Need Help?**\n• Website: https://cybercrime.gov.in\n• Helpline: **1930** (24x7)\n• Email: report@cybercrime.gov.in\n\n**📚 Sources Used:**\n_Click section links below to view original PDFs on cybercrime.gov.in_\n\n**📖 Citizen Manual** — [View](https://cybercrime.gov.in/Webform/Citizen_Manual.aspx)\n  • MHA-CitizenManualReportOtherCyberCrime-v10 (Page 18.0) — 41%\n  • MHA-CitizenManualReportOtherCyberCrime-v10 (Page 66.0) — 37%\n  • MHA-CitizenManualReportCPRGRcomplaints-v10 (Page 32.0) — 36%\n  • MHA-CitizenManualReportOtherCyberCrime-v10 (Page 45.0) — 35%\n  • MHA-CitizenManualReportOtherCyberCrime-v10 (Page 36.0) — 34%\n\n**🔗 Explore:**\n[Citizen Manual](https://cybercrime.gov.in/Webform/Citizen_Manual.aspx) | [Safety Tips](https://cybercrime.gov.in/Webform/Crime_OnlineSafetyTips.aspx) | [Awareness](https://cybercrime.gov.in/Webform/CyberAware.aspx) | [Daily Digest](https://cybercrime.gov.in/Webform/dailyDigest.aspx)\n\n_✅ AI-powered | 🇮🇳 Govt of India_",
